		<h2><em>What are you grateful for?</em></h2>
		<p>I am grateful for all that have supported me on this journey towards becoming a software developer.  The learning never ends and that is the most exciting piece of all of this.  I have found a new community of artist and creative individuals that are driven and passionate about the work that they do.  <strong>I'm having a blast!!</strong></p>
